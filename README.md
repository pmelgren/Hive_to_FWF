# Hive_to_FWF
This repository contains simplified, anonymized code and data from a simple Python coding contract I took as a freelancer. The purpose of this repository is to accompany a video where I walkthrough the code as a tutorial for new Python developers. 

All data is made up and any identifying information from the original client has been removed.
